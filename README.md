# Etch-a-Sketch Project

A browser-based sketchpad built as part of The Odin Project Foundations course.  
This project practices DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic grid creation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

 
Current Features:

-Dynamic grid generation

-Hover-to-draw coloring

-Button to change grid size (1–100)

-Automatically adjusts square sizes to keep the grid square

- Random color applied to each square on first hover
- Squares progressively darken with each interaction (10 steps to full opacity)

What I’ve Learned:

-Creating DOM elements with JavaScript

-Adding event listeners programmatically

-Handling input with prompt()

-Validating user input

-Clearing and rebuilding page elements

-Using dynamic calculations to control layout

Planned Features:

-Clear grid option

-Eraser tool

-Random color mode

-Shading/darkening mode

-Click-to-draw mode
